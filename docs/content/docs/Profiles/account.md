## Profile 
Your profile is visible to all Atlos users. It includes:
- Your username
- Your profile photo
- Your bio
- A list of the projects of which you’re a member
- A feed of your recent updates
- A list of the incidents to which you're assigned
- A list of the incidents to which you've subscribed
- A list of the incidents you've recently edited

Note that investigators on Atlos will only be able to see updates and projects on your profile that they would otherwise have access to—if someone is not a member of a project, they won’t see your update to an incident in that project just because they navigated to your profile page. 

### Edit your profile 
To edit your bio or profile image:
1. Navigate to the **Account** page by clicking **Account** on the left sidebar menu. 
2. Edit your bio.
3. Press **Save** after making changes to your profile. 

To edit your username or email address, please email the Atlos team at contact@atlos.org.
