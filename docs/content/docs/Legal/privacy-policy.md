We take your privacy seriously. The full version is below, but the simple version is this: Atlos tries to collect as little information from our users as possible. Unless you pay for the platform, we don't even ask for your name. Atlos is a non-profit, open source project. Our goal isn't to sell you targeted ads — it's only to support your visual investigations. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to contact@atlos.org.

### Do Not Track Signals
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature. It lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want
them to track your online activity. These features are not yet uniform across browsers. Our Sites are
thus not currently set up to respond to these signals. For more information on Do Not Track signals,
please visit [https://allaboutdnt.com/](https://allaboutdnt.com/).
