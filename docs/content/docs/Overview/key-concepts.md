It's important to understand several core concepts before getting started:
- **Incidents are the atom of Atlos.** [Incidents](/incidents/incidents/) describe a single event and are the core unit of content on Atlos. They include one or more pieces of source material. 
- **You can upload or archive source material.** To add [source material](/incidents/source-material/)—like photos, videos, or websites—you can upload files or use our automatic web archival system.
- **Projects are the unit of investigations.** To begin an investigation, create a [project](/investigations/projects/) and [share](/investigations/collaboration/) it with your team. 
- **All data on Atlos is private by default.** To collaborate, first share your investigation by sending a project invite link to your team.
- **It's easy to import an investigation from a spreadsheet.** If you'd like to move an investigation from a spreadsheet on Atlos, create a new project, navigate to its Manage page, and [bulk import](/investigations/import-and-export-data/#data-import) a CSV.
